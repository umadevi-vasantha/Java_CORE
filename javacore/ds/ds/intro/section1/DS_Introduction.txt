1. What is Data Structure?
Data Structure are different ways of organizing the data on computer/system. so that the data can be used in efficient way.

All applications are dealing with data , some operations will be performed on the given data
Before processing the data we have to organize the data in certain way in order to make the process efficient.

From Applications point of view the efficiency and performance of the software depends on, how the data is stored, organized, grouped together during the program execution.

2. What is Algorithm?
Set of instruction to perform a Task
Set of instruction/rules for a computer program to accomplish a Task

Sample algorithm used in big companies
How to find the shortest path on the Google Map -  Graph algorithms
How to Google and Facebook transmit live video across the internet? - Compression algorithm

What makes a good algorithm? Correctness and Efficiency

Why are Data Structures and Algorithms important??
As a software or computer science , responsibility is to perform operations on data. First we take data as input ,then we process it, and then we give back the processed data as output.
So it make the software work efficiently its important to make the processing part efficient(We need to optimize the processing part) , there comes the importance of the Data Structure and Algorithm.

Types of Data Structure

Data Structures can be mainly classified into,

Primitive Data Structures:
The Data Structure which built which are basic data structures which are building blocks of any program.
 Integer
 Float
 Character
 Boolean

Non Primitive data Structures:
There are user defined data structures and they are derived from Primitive data structures.
 Linear Data Structures:
 In Linear Data Structures the items are arranged in linear sequential manner.And they can be further classified
  A> Static: Array
  In Static Linear Data Structures the sizes and structures associated with memory location is Fixed.
  B> Dynamic: Linked List, Stack, Queue
 
 Non Linear Data Structures:
In Non Linear Data Structures the items are not arranged in sequential manner.
  A> Tree
  B> Graph
