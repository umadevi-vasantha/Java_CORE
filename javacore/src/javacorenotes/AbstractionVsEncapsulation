Abstraction and encapsulation are two key concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), and they are often used together. However, they address different aspects of designing and implementing software.

Abstraction:
Definition:
-------------
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share.
It involves hiding the unnecessary details of an object and exposing only the relevant features.
Purpose:
---------
The main purpose of abstraction is to manage complexity by focusing on the essential characteristics of an object while ignoring the non-essential details.
Example:
------------
In Java, abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction. For example, an abstract class Shape might define a method draw(), and concrete subclasses like Circle and Rectangle provide specific implementations.

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}
Encapsulation:
Definition:
-------------
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.
It involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components and only allowing access through well-defined interfaces (getters and setters).
Purpose:
------------
The main purpose of encapsulation is to hide the internal details of an object and protect its state from being modified directly by external code.
Example:
------------
In Java, encapsulation is achieved by declaring fields (attributes) as private and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access or modify those fields.

public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        // Additional validation or logic can be added here
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        // Additional validation or logic can be added here
        this.age = age;
    }
}
Key Differences:
Focus:
--------
Abstraction focuses on the external characteristics of an object, emphasizing what an object does.
Encapsulation focuses on the internal implementation details of an object, emphasizing how an object achieves its functionality.
Level of Detail:
---------------
Abstraction involves the concept of modeling classes at a higher level, emphasizing essential features while omitting unnecessary details.
Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods into a single unit, emphasizing the organization and protection of internal details.
Implementation:
---------------
Abstraction is often implemented using abstract classes and interfaces to define a common interface for a group of related classes.
Encapsulation is implemented through the use of access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control access to the internal components of a class.




Data Hiding Vs Encapsulation :
----------------------------------------------

Data hiding and encapsulation are closely related concepts in object-oriented programming, but they address different aspects of designing and organizing code. Let's explore the differences between data hiding and encapsulation:

Data Hiding:
Definition:

Data hiding is the concept of restricting the access to certain details of an object and exposing only the necessary information.
It involves preventing the direct access to internal implementation details or data members of a class.
Purpose:

The main purpose of data hiding is to enhance security, maintainability, and flexibility in a software system.
It helps in preventing unintended interference with the internal state of an object.
Implementation:

Data hiding is typically implemented through access modifiers (such as private, protected, and public) in object-oriented languages like Java or C++.
For example, making certain fields private ensures that they can only be accessed or modified through methods defined in the class.
java
Copy code
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter and setter methods provide controlled access to the private fields
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        // Additional validation or logic can be added here
        this.name = name;
    }
}
Encapsulation:
Definition:

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.
It involves combining the implementation details and the access control mechanisms to achieve a well-organized and modular design.
Purpose:

The main purpose of encapsulation is to group related data and functionality together and to control the access to the internal details of an object.
It provides a way to structure the code, hide implementation details, and expose a well-defined interface.
Implementation:

Encapsulation is implemented by creating classes and organizing data members and methods within those classes.
Access to the internal state is provided through well-defined public methods, and the internal details are hidden from external code.
java
Copy code
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    // Methods provide controlled access to the private field
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        // Additional validation or logic can be added here
        balance += amount;
    }
}
Key Differences:
Scope:

Data hiding specifically refers to restricting access to the internal state or data members of a class.
Encapsulation is a broader concept that involves bundling data and methods together in a class.
Focus:

Data hiding is more concerned with controlling access to the internal state of an object.
Encapsulation is concerned with both organizing the internal structure of a class and controlling access to it.
Implementation:

Data hiding is achieved through access modifiers to restrict direct access to certain parts of a class.
Encapsulation is implemented by creating classes, organizing data and methods within those classes, and controlling access through access modifiers.
In summary, while data hiding focuses on restricting access to internal state, encapsulation is a broader concept that involves organizing code by bundling data
and methods together within a class. Encapsulation includes data hiding as one of its principles, and both contribute to building modular and maintainable code.
