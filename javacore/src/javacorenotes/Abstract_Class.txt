Abstract Class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed by other classes

1. Abstract class is declared with the 'abstract' keyword.
2. It may have both abstract and non abstract methods(methods with implementation)
3. An abstract is a Java modifier applicable for classes and methods in Java but not for Variables.
4. An instance of an abstract class can not be created
5. Constructor are allowed.
6. We can have an abstract class without any abstract method.
7. There can be final method in abstract class but not abstract final method..Because any method declared as final cannot be overridden,
. However the purpose of an abstract class is to provide a declaration in the abstract class that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses.
8. Same way there can be static method in the abstract class but not abstract method.. Because any method declared as static cannot be overridden,
However the purpose of an abstract class is to provide a declaration in the abstract class that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses.
9. We can make outer and inner class as abstract.
10. If class contains atleast one abstract method, then we should declare class as abstract compulsorily.
11. If the Child class is unable to provide implementation to all abstract methods of the Parent class then we should declare that Child class
as abstract so that the next level Child class should provide implementation to the remaining abstract method
