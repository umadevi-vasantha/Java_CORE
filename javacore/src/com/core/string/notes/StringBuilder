StringBuilder and StringBuffer are both classes in Java that are used to manipulate strings efficiently, especially when there is a
need for frequent modifications to the content of the string. They are both of the java.lang package.

The main difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer lies in their synchronization behavior:

1. StringBuilder :
   Introduced in Java 5.
   Not synchronized, which means it is not thread-safe.
   More efficient in single-threaded environments.
   Should be used when the string manipulation is done in a single-threaded context or when synchronization is not a concern.
   
   StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder("Hello");
   stringBuilder.append("World");
   String result = stringBuilder.toString();
   
2. StringBuffer:
   Introduced in the early versions of Java.
   Synchronized, making it thread-safe.
   Slower than StringBuilder in a single-threaded environment due to the overhead of synchronization.
   Should be used in multi-threaded environments where multiple threads may be trying to modify the same string.
   
   StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");
   stringBuffer.append(" World");
   String result = stringBuffer.toString();
   

If we are working in a single-threaded environment or if we are sure that  there won't be any concurrency issues, using StringBuilder
is recommended for better performance. If thread safety is a concern, and your application involves multiple threads manipulating the same string, 
then StringBuffer should be used despite its potential overhead.



StringBuilder is not thread-safe, meaning it is not designed to be used safely in a multi-threaded environment.
If multiple threads try to modify a 'StringBuilder' object concurrently, it can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption.

StringBuffer is tread-safe, which means it is designed to be used safely in a multi-threaded environment.
It achieves thread safety by synchronizing its methods, making sure that only one thread can execute a method on a 'StringBuffer' object at a time.
