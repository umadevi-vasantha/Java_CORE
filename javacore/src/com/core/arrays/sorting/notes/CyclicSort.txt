Cyclic Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that is based on the idea of efficiently sorting an array of integers when the values are in a certain range. The basic idea is to iterate through the array and place each element in its correct position by swapping it with the element at that position.

Here's a detailed explanation of the Cyclic Sort algorithm:

Procedure:
Understanding the Range:

The algorithm assumes that the elements of the array are integers in a specific range, often starting from 0 or 1 up to a certain maximum value.
Iteration through the Array:

Start iterating through the array.
For each element encountered, determine its correct position in the sorted array.
Placing Elements in Correct Position:

If the element is not already in its correct position, swap it with the element at its correct position.
Repeat this process until the element is in its correct position.
Moving to the Next Element:

Move on to the next element in the array and repeat the process until all elements are placed in their correct positions.


Example:
Let's consider an array [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]. The correct positions for each element would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The Cyclic Sort algorithm works as follows:

Start with index i = 0. The element at index 0 is 3, and its correct position is 3. Since they are equal, move to the next index.
At index 1, the element is 1, and its correct position is 1. Again, they are equal, so move to the next index.
At index 2, the element is 5, and its correct position is 3. Swap 5 with the element at index 3.
The array becomes [3, 1, 4, 5, 2]. Continue this process until all elements are in their correct positions.

##### BEST CASE  AND WORST CASE - TIME COMPLEXITY #####

Cyclic Sort has a consistent time complexity in both the best and worst-case scenarios. Let's break down the analysis:

### Best-Case Time Complexity:

The best-case scenario occurs when the input array is already sorted. In this situation, as the algorithm iterates through the array, it will find that each element is already in its correct position. Therefore, no swaps are needed. The time complexity for this case is still O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Worst-Case Time Complexity:

The worst-case scenario happens when every element in the array needs to be moved to its correct position. In this case, the algorithm will perform a swap for each element, resulting in n swaps in total. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

### Explanation:

The key insight into the time complexity analysis lies in the fact that, regardless of the initial ordering of the elements, each element is moved to its correct position in a single pass through the array. Since the algorithm has a linear time complexity, the best and worst-case scenarios both result in O(n) time complexity.

It's worth noting that Cyclic Sort's efficiency is particularly evident in scenarios where the range of values in the array is small, making it a favorable choice for certain situations. However, it might not be the most efficient algorithm for general sorting purposes, especially when compared to more advanced algorithms like quicksort or mergesort in typical scenarios.




Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) since the sorting is done in-place, and no additional space is used proportional to the input size.

Cyclic Sort is particularly useful when the range of values in the array is relatively small, making it a simple and efficient sorting algorithm in such cases
