Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called "Literal/Constant"

1. Integer Literals: These represent whole number(without decimal points)
a. Decimal (Base 10): Regular numbers eg int x=100
b. Octal(Base 8): Numbers starting with 0 eg int y=075; represents decimal 61)
c. Hexadecimal(Base 16): Numbers starting with 0x eg: int 0x1F( represents decimal 31)
d. Binary (Base 2) : Number starting with 0b or 0B eg int a= 0b1010 (represents decimal 10).


2. Floating Point Literals:
These represent numbers with decimal points or in scientific notation.
a. Simple Decimal : eg double x= 3.14;
b. Scientific Notation: eg  double y=1.23e4;(which represents 1.23*10^4)

3. Boolean literals: These represents Logical values
a. true or false eg: boolean isTrue-=true;

4. Character Literals: These represents character and are enclosed in single quotes.
Ex: Char c= 'A';
we can also use escape sequence like '\n' ,'\t' ,'\'' , '\\'

5. String Literals: These are sequence of character enclosed in double quotes.
